For our MAE 3230 (Fluid Mechanics) Course, we sought out to dissect & analyze a fluid mechanical device (a bike trainer). Upon taking apart the trainer, we indentified it as a power-dissipative turbine and began the process of characterizing its behavior using fundamental fluid mechanical principles. Some of my roles included determining an appropriate method to characterize the turbine (since it lacked inward/outward flow), co-writing the script with other group members, partcipating in the general physical dissection video, and finally explaining the physical characteristics of the turbine and they relate to its fluid mechanical behavior.
