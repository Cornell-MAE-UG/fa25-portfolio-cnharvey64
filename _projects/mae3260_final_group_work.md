For our MAE 3260 (System Dynamics) Course, we sought out to improve a coffee warming system first introduced to us in Exam 1. The system performed with significant steady state error and a long rise time, two factors that are not ideal when trying to warm coffee in the morning. Through the use of PI/PID control, we improved the system to conform to our own set of performance metrics. The report is shown below.
