## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

My name is Cameron Harvey and I'm a student in Cornell University's College of Engineering studying Mechanical Engineering and pursuing a minor through the Dyson Business Minor for Engineers program, with an expected graduation date of May 2027. At Cornell, I work in the Mechanical and Aerospace Department's Rapid Prototyping Lab (RPL) as a manager and have taken on a number of roles on the Cornell FSAE Racing Team. Beyond Cornell, I've also worked as a trading intern at Merus Global Investments, exploring short term equities & options trading. In the future, I aspire to take on roles in design engineering or business.
